<p>
Hai Wang received the BS degree from Huazhong University of Science and
Technology, China, and the MS and PhD degrees from University of
California, Riverside, in 2007, 2008, and 2012, respectively. He is
currently an associate professor with the University of Electronic
Science and Technology of China. His research interests include
modeling, optimization, and artificial intelligence assisted design automation of VLSI circuits and systems. He has served as technical program committee member of several international conferences including
DATE, ASP-DAC and ISQED, and also served as reviewer of many journals
including IEEE Transactions on Computers, IEEE Transactions on
Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, and ACM
Transactions on Design Automation of Electronic Systems. He received one Best
Paper Award nomination from ASP-DAC in 2019.
